Running Geoquery Experiment:

All the configuration should be configured in config.ini
- Locate all software dependencies there 
- TRAIN, TUNE, TUNE_TEST (test the tune), TEST = true for do, empty for not.

Experiment parameters are located in:
script/experiment/part/parameters.sh

Modifying how-to-run experiment:
script/experiment/part/execute.sh

Order running the experiment:
1. Configure everything, make sure every dependencies are linked.

2. First generate (or use) the id.
   
   $ script/prepare/wong-id.sh
   This will generate the id/wong-split directories.
   The important thing is to also generate the 10-folds directory for tuning.
   The experiment is 10-folds, for each fold, another 10-folds are done against it for tuning.

3. Generate the data 
   This will map the id, to the real geoquery data.

   $ script/prepare/data.sh
   This will prepare the full-question data. 
   The full-question data is used for baseline experiment.

   $ script/prepare/kw.sh
   This will prepare the in-order simulated keyword data.

   $ script/prepare/data-kwshuf-real.sh
   This will prepare the shuffled keyword data

4. Run the experiment.
   All the experiment are located in "script/experiment" directories.

   baseline.sh -> Baseline experiment
   keyword.sh -> Direct keyword-MR (Meaning Representation)
   keyword-shuf.sh -> Direct shuffled-MR
   kw.sh -> 3Sync k-MR without LM
   kw-q.sh -> kw.sh + Question LM
   kw-news.sh -> kw.sh + News LM
   kw-geo.sh -> kw.sh + GEO LM
   kw-geonews.sh -> kw.sh + GEO-NEWS LM
   kw-geoq.sh -> kw.sh + GEO-Q LM
   kw-geoall.sh -> kw.sh + GEO-NEWS-Q LM
   kw-shuf-**.sh -> 3Sync shuffled-MR + **LM
